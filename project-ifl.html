                <p class="mb-0 text-black-50">This project was the final deliverable of the course Physical Interaction Design. 
                    During 5 intense weeks (from September to mid-October) we worked to realise a small scale model that followed 
                    the theme of designing for a winter playground: 
                </p><br/>
                <p class="mb-0 text-black-50"><i>&quot;The task is to develop a piece of interactive playground equipment for the 
                    Swedish winter situation. You will have to explore the design space of bringing interactive technology outdoors, 
                    focusing on technical as well as experiential challenges of designing large scale interactive systems for cold, 
                    dark and wet play settings.&quot;</i>

                <p class="mb-0 text-black-50">The project was kickstarted through a bodystorming session, where we were assigned 
                    to carry out a visit to a playground at nighttime. The purpose of this session was to reconnect with playgrounds 
                    and gain an understanding of the place in conditions similar to the Swedish winter, when daylight in 
                    non-existent past 3 p.m.

                <p class="mb-0 text-black-50">An issue that rose during the playground visit was the extremely poor lighting, making 
                    the place seem both unfriendly and unsafe - far from the adventurous environment it is in daylight. From this 
                    background, and along with research into interactive play, our team defined our goals:
                </p><br/>
                <ol class="text-black-50">
                    <li>Bring more light to playgrounds and find new innovative ways of making the lighting of playgrounds a part of the play experience.</li>
                    <li>Allow for an open-ended play setting, while still adding a sense of guided play and mystery to engage users in the interaction.</li>
                    <li>Promote social interaction and collaboration among playground visitors.</li>

                <p class="mb-0 text-black-50">Apart from the above, my responsibilities also involved the setup of the technology 
                    (constructing the circuit, connecting sensors and LED-strip), as well as the programming of the light scripts 
                    and the interaction with the sensors.

                  the slideshow. We aimed at the creation of a game, which allowed for both guided and open-ended play.

                <p class="mb-0 text-black-50">Our final design was inspired by the white winter landscape and how it 
                    reflects and disperses light. As for the shape of the trees in our model, we aimed at more 
                    fairytale-like style, inspired by the 
                    <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b1/28/bb/b128bba819e384bc42260c36ed1701a4.png" target="_blank">
                      mushroom forest of Alice in Wonderland</a>. This shape was also favoured for its potential 
                    to work as a shelter from harsh weather conditions and heavy rain, as well as a possibility of creating a 
                    protective shell over the lights and electronics. The lights were inspired by the 
                    <a href ="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/82/6a/8e/826a8e6fb259b7ee2efd2d790e746e94.jpg" target="_blank">

                <h4 class="text-black text-uppercase">The model</h4>
                <p class="mb-0 text-black-50">The model was built on a 900 SEK budget, where most of the costs went 
                  into the strip of 200 addressable NeoPixel LEDs. Together with borrowed and scrap materials, the trees 
                  were constructed using chicken wire, papier mache and white paint. The electronics included a LED-strip 
                  soldered the desired length, an Arduino board, flex sensors, and a passive infrared motion sensor.

            <div class="d-flex h-100">

                <h4 class="text-black text-uppercase">The technology</h4>
                <p class="mb-0 text-black-50">The interactive part of the installation was made through the creation of a light 
                  script for the Arduino board. The code was written using C/C++ and listens to the installation's 4 sensors 
                  (three flex sensors, one infrared motion sensor). Depending on which sensor is interacted with, the code 
                  fires its corresponding light script. To give the user a hint of where the sensors are located, all sensors 
                  had their own personal light signal.
                </p><br />
                <p class="mb-0 text-black-50">
                  We also implemented a 5 second timer, which allowed the triggering additional light scripts when two or more 
                  sensors were interacted with at approximately the same time. This is how we implemented the “communication” 
                  among the trees; light scripts that ran only when multiple sensors were triggered.

                <h4 class="text-black text-uppercase">Fulfilling the goals</h4>
                <p class="mb-0 text-black-50">By allowing the illumination of playgrounds to become a part of the play experience, 
                  we can create a more engaging experience for its visitors, prolonging it use, especially in wintertime when 
                  daylight is scarce.
                </p><br/>
                <p class="mb-0 text-black-50">Turning the light installation into a game, where visitors can explore different 
                  ways to get the forest to light up, allowed our solution to span a larger target group - both young and older 
                  children (or even parents) can engage in the interaction, at their own preferred level. Finally, the use of 
                  the many sensors pushes visitors to interact and collaborate with each other in order to get the forest 
                  to light up fully.

                <p class="mb-0 text-black-50">Throughout the design process, we had the possibility to test our installation 
                  with children of different ages. This led to the addition of the pearl curtain, to encourage more use of movement 
                  when interacting with the installation. We also found the children were particularly mesmerized by the prism-like 
                  effect when the pearls refract the light.
                </p><br />
                <p class="mb-0 text-black-50">At the final exhibition of the Physical Interaction Design course, people of all ages 
                  engaged in our installation. We found that the visitors spent a lot of time at the installation, trying to trigger 
                  the many light scripts. People particularly enjoyed the "full forest dance" with multi-coloured lights, but had 
                  somewhat of a hard time figuring out what triggered it, however this lead to a more playful enivronment among the 
                  users, trying to solve the problem together.
