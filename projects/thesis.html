            <p>
              In the final project towards my M.Sc.Eng degree I set out to explore 
              information visualization in the context of 5G. Together with telecom 
              company Telia, I researched what the future of private cellular networks 
              may look like for industrial enterprises.
            </p>
            <p>Particularly, this project set out to explore the affordances and 
              challenges with information visualization of data in 5G networks as a 
              mean to communicate and showcase 5G’s private network solutions to 
              industry enterprises.

            <h5 class="sec-heading mb-2">The Future with 5G</h5>
            <p>There has been a lot of buzz surrounding 5G ‒ the next generation of 
              cellular networks, which with its great increase in data speeds promises 
              the arrival of our new, highly connected future.</p>
            <p>With 5G comes the promise of cellular networks that can cater to a much 
              larger number of connected devices, deal with a vast increase in data 
              traffic and deliver response times remarkably close to real-time. 5G is 
              therefore very likely to play a key role in what has been coined the 4th 
              industrial revolution: the increased connection of IoT devices to 
              manufacturing processes to increase both automation and data-driven 
              decision making in industry.</p>
            <p>Yet, that brief summary probably did very little to help you paint 
              a picture of what 5G may look like in practice!</p>

            <h5 class="sec-heading mb-2">Giving Private Cellular Networks a Face</h5>
            <p>Latency, throughput, availability… there are lots of technical terms 
              associated with cellular networks. While these may be very familiar to 
              the trained network operator and the hobby enthusiast on Internet 
              connectivity, they may not say much to the average joe.</p>
            <p>With the introduction of 5G comes the increased potential of private 
              cellular networks ‒ network solutions separated from the general public 
              (and with it, the issues that come with shared traffic usage). The 
              private cellular solution allows for another level of tailoring and 
              optimisation of the network to the needs of the enterprise.</p>
            <p>These network solutions are typically promoted by speaking of numbers. 
              <i>“Latency will be down to 1 millisecond compared to the 20-200 
                milliseconds we see with 4G today”</i>, <i>“throughput will increase 
                by 100 times”</i>, <i>“5G will have 99.999% availability”</i>. 
              But speaking solely of numbers rarely paints the picture!</p>
            <p>Information visualization is one tool we can use to give these 
              technical terms a new life and added meaning to the enterprise 
              customer looking to invest in such a solution.</p>

            <h5 class="sec-heading mb-2">The Challenge</h5>
            <p>Dashboards are today the common tool for utilising information 
              visualization in enterprises, often referred to as Business 
              Intelligence tools. They are not necessarily new for the manufacturing 
              industries either, or within network management. The interest and 
              challenge here lie between the two: when network management becomes 
              a key player in industry performance.</p>
            <p>Likely, the importance of understanding and managing the network will 
              move beyond the traditional network operator. This means we need to 
              find new ways of communicating the data, making it easy to grasp even 
              for the “network newbie”. And in doing so, we can also provide a visual 
              selling point for investing in a complex technological solution!</p>
            <p>In this project, I sought to define the affordances and challenges 
              of such use of information visualization in a dashboard tool for 
              showcasing 5G’s private cellular networks.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">From a product design point of view the process of this project 
              might look a little curious, as perhaps should be! The process 
              of this project also highly reflects its associated scientific 
              report, that is the traditional <i>Introduction ‒ Theory and Related 
                Work ‒ Research Question ‒ Method ‒ Result ‒ Discussion ‒ 
                Conclusion</i> steps of academic research.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p><b>Research. Research. Research.</b> This project was just 
                  as much about the academic paper as the project itself. To build 
                  a solid foundation to work from, I investigated 5G technology and 
                  its expected impact on industry.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>Selection of key network parameters.</b> Based on the knowledge 
                  acquired about 5G, I picked five concepts that clearly captured the 
                  benefits that 5G brings and are likely to come of key importance to 
                  industries moving forward.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>Data gathering.</b> In order to visualize the five selected 
                  parameters ‒ throughput, latency, availability, coverage and 
                  connected devices ‒ I needed to understand how they are measured 
                  and reported. What it looks like today and how it might expand with 
                  5G tomorrow.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>Best practices and SotA.</b> The second part to visualizing 
                  something, apart from having data to feed the visualization with, 
                  is of course understanding how to best do it! This meant diving into 
                  material such as Stephen Few’s “Information Dashboard Design” and 
                  Tableau Software’s whitepapers on visualization. I also reviewed a 
                  large number of dashboards used within manufacturing industries, in 
                  network management and IoT to get the full picture of the current 
                  state of development.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>Ideation and defining hypotheses.</b> Based on the data gathered 
                  and the best practices reviewed, I did a brainstorm session to define 
                  hypotheses on how each network parameter is best visualized to convey 
                  its meaning and value in relation to 5G. This step was continuously 
                  reiterated in conversation with my supervisors.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>Development and expert review of the research prototype.</b>
                  Here’s where you might have expected a user evaluation and didn’t 
                  find one! Working with such an into-the-future-product, it is hard 
                  to work based on an intended end-user when so much of the field remains 
                  unknown. Instead, I began evaluating the prototype with experts within 
                  UX with previous experience of developing tools in similar areas. This 
                  with the goal of maximising how communicative the visualizations were 
                  in relation to 5G, to ease engagement with industry.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>Industry interview.</b> Having gathered tons of helpful feedback 
                  from the expert review I set out to discuss dashboard tools and 
                  visualization with industry to further discover and refine affordances 
                  and challenges. The interview focused on the current application of 
                  dashboard tools in industry, how the network plays part in how 
                  manufacturing processes run today, and what role the developed 
                  visualizations may play moving forward.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>Suggested design.</b> Based on the expert review and notes from the 
                  industry interview, a final mock-up was made to aid the findings with a 
                  more visual example. The idea of the mock-up was also to generate a sense 
                  of direction for the future of the project, and a clearer product idea 
                  that could be used in conversation with enterprises to continue a more 
                  user-driven development of the tool.</p>

            <p>While information visualizations in part can be showcased through 
              various low to high fidelity prototypes, their concepts are hard to 
              communicate through limited interactions. With the projects main 
              purpose to properly evaluate information visualization as a tool, 
              the prototype was directly built in a more Minimum Viable Product 
              form.</p>
            <p>The prototype was developed using the JavaScript component 
              library React, alongside the visualization library D3. The Research 
              Prototype was centred around finding the optimal way to represent 
              the five selected network parameters and can be viewed in the demo

                throughput, what is latency etc). However, for the “network newbie”, 
                this might not be enough to understand what value 5G’s private 
                cellular networks bring.</p>

                <p><b>Visualizing the network parameters in a relatable context</b>
                  (such as the use of maps and calendars) may be a way to make 
                  these parameters more accessible for the “network newbies”.</p>

                <p><b>A clear preference for the ‘Coverage and Devices’ view.</b> 
                  This suggests that putting the parameters in a spatial context 
                  ‒ seeing not only how they vary over time, but also over 
                  geographical space ‒ could be a promising way forward in terms 
                  of making the tool valuable for industry.</p>

              <li>
                <p><b>Get more action-centred.</b> Successful tools today are 
                  very action centric-and it is unclear how the visualizations 
                  might fit in in such a context. The views are currently great 
                  for analytical work over time, but it remains unclear whether 
                  a user would visit these parameters aside from when an error 
                  occurs. The context of what went wrong, where did it go wrong 
                  and what action must I, the user, take to resolve the issue? 
                  would likely be a highly valuable addition.</p>

            </ol>
            <p>Summarising the findings, it is clear that the proposed tool needs 
              to get better at communicating the industry fit, i.e. how these 
              parameters relate and integrate into industry operations. Visual 
              representations of this type of early demonstration of ideas are 
              likely to be highly valuable in terms of engaging and facilitating 
              conversations with industry and increasing the likelihood of future 
              successes in the development of a dashboard tool for 5G’s private 
              cellular network solutions.</p>

            <p>To sum up the findings more visually, and to provide some guidance 
              of what direction future development of a dashboard tool for 5G’s 
              private cellular networks could take, a brief reiteration was made.</p>
            <p>As I hope you, the reader, likely has understood by now, the state of 
              still attempting to predict the future with 5G shaped this project 
              to be more of an exploration than a final design! Therefore, below 
              follows a more "refined" prototype to provide ideas for how a dashboard 
              tool may serve private 5G networks in the future. As well as a take on 
              how the tool explored in this thesis could become more action-centric:</p>
