            Since the introduction of persuasive design into the development of modern 
            technologies, researchers have considered how aspects of persuasion may be 
            incorporated to push the user of the technology to do good. One of the areas 
            that has seen the application of such attempts is apps developed to tackle 
            behaviours related to the ongoing climate crisis.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-0 proj-intro">
            This project explored the use of persuasive strategies from a critical design 
            perspective. Through the evaluation and redesign of the CERO Challenge app, 
            developed to promote pro-environmental travel behaviours, we considered which 
            strategies align with long term pro-environmental behaviour change and 
            how they affect the design.

            This project was a part of the Advanced Project Course in Interactive Media 
            Technology, where the organisation 
            <a href="https://cero.nu/" target="_blank">
              CERO (Climate and Economic Research in Organizations) 
            </a>

            Working alongside classmates Diego Martin, Fredilyn Villarin, Marco Koivisto 
            and Rafael Lucena, the project was conducted under the guidance of our 
            supervisor Elina Eriksson, who brought expertise within ICT for sustainability.
          </p><p>
            While all five of us contributed in all aspects of the project, Diego and Marco 
            took the design lead. Being highly engaged in behavioural psychology and its 
            relation to modern app and web development, I took the scientific lead and conducted 
            most of the research that the project was based on top of.

          <p>
            The mission of CERO is to help companies find economically sustainable ways of 
            reducing their emissions, particularly with focus on the travel habits of the 
            company’s workforce. CERO Challenge is an app developed by the team behind CERO, 
            which had the purpose of tracking individual travel behaviour and to enable users 
            of the app to challenge each other to reduce emissions. At its current state it 
            does not have a connection to the CERO organisation and is no longer in use.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team was given the challenge to help the client resurrect the app, turning it 
            to a bottom-up tool to help companies raise awareness and engagement in their CERO 
            goals on employee level. And in doing so, exploring alternative motivations, besides 
            the common gamification and engagement tactics, that could drive the application.

        <div class="col-lg-7">
          <p>
            The previous application struggled with intuitive navigation and the user 
            was repetitively asked to log the data of each trip. A first objective was 
            therefore to make this process less cumbersome for the user, while still 
            keeping the data accurate.
          </p>
          <p>
            The app also struggled with displaying its data to the user in a meaningful 
            way. We therefore sought to explore multiple ways in which travel data could 
            be presented to not only making travel impact easier to understand, but to do 
            so in a way that prompted the user to engage in reducing their travel impact. 
            We interviewed several stakeholders that were involved in the implementation 
            of CERO at their workplace, to gain an understanding of their ideal expectations 
            on the app. Both as someone who wanted to spur their colleagues engagement, 
            but also as with themselves as the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being out of use, it also needed an aesthetic update to adhere to app design 
            guidelines. The client also wished to more tightly connect the app with the 
            organisations work, including a leaderboard of the top performing companies. 
            But foremost, we needed to tackle the challenge of making the app promote and 
            encourage pro-environmental behaviour change, and that was not an easy feat!

        <div class="col-lg-7">
          <p>
            Making use of technology to promote pro-environmental behaviours is a difficult task for 
            several reasons. Today, many modern apps make use of persuasive design to catch and keep 
            the user’s attention. This includes features such as attention-grabbing colours, 
            notifications, heavily personalised content and gamification. However, researchers 
            exploring the field of persuasive design used for promoting sustainability 
            <a href="#references">[1, 2]</a> have found that many of these features significantly 
            clash with attempts to encourage pro-environmental behaviours.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a part of our project we dealt with the challenges introduced by Schwartz’s circumplex 
            structure of values <a href="#references">[3]</a>, particularly self-enhancement vs. 
            self-transcendence values and its implications for understanding human motivation. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Apps developed in Western societies, just like the these societies in general, are highly 
            permeated by self-enhancement values, i.e. values related to the welfare of oneself. 
            Such as pursuing one’s own interests and concern for one’s own success, where social 
            comparison and recognition are highly valued. Self-enhancement values are also known to 
            undermine pro-environmental behaviour change. On the other hand, self-transcendence values; 
            the welfare and interest in others, are known for bringing about pro-environmental behaviours 
            through for example social facilitation and cooperation. And it was with this as our 
            perspective that we approached the design.

            To reduce some of the repetitiveness of the app (the user having to personally log 
            each trip) we decided to aim for easiness over perfect accuracy. Rather than aiming 
            for automatic tracking solutions, we worked from the basis of us humans as highly 
            habitual; most of us have very distinct travel patterns to and from work. Asking 
            the user for their travel habits once (with the option to update this in the app 
            settings later) makes the experience more convenient.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was clear from the link to the clients work with the organisation that we would be 
            working with carbon calculation of some sort. At the current standpoint in time
            sustainability is often presented to users as either side of a coin: this is the kilograms 
            of CO<sub>2</sub> you have wasted, or, this is the kilograms of CO<sub>2</sub> you saved. 
            But what difference does a kg of CO<sub>2</sub> make? And what implications do the words 
            “waste” versus “save” have on the user making the effort? We examined these questions with our 
            interviewees and found positive reinforcement to be the way forward. Relating to nature’s 
            natural carbon savers ‒ trees, was the preferred way of materialising carbon emission 
            savings into something comprehensible.
          </p>
          <p>
            We shifted the core of the app to be all about community. Joining challenges together 
            and endorsing one another to bring in self-transcendence values; social facilitation 
            and cooperation.

          <h5 class="sec-heading">Lessons learned</h5>
          <p>
            For me, this project was particularly enthralling to take on because it gave us the 
            opportunity to think about our design choices from a new perspective. It is so easy 
            to go along with established design and persuasion tactics employed in most applications 
            today, without critically evaluating what motivations they build on. And in extension to 
            that, how they can shape our way of thinking and behaving.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project was also extremely challenging because we had to find design solutions 
            aiming to promote values which our Western society, to most part, does not regularly 
            reflect over or attend to.
          </p>

          <h5 class="sec-heading">Outcomes</h5>
          <p>
            Our final design was very positively received by the client as well as the sustainable 
            ICT research community at KTH. It was praised for its new approach to tackling 
            pro-environmental behaviour change and for its attempt to balance out the “negative” 
            drivers and motivators commonly employed in apps with the focus on communal efforts 
            and social support.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two members of our team continued working with the client in their master 
            thesis projects, to further examine the potential of the app with users.
