          <p class="mb-5">
            This project was the final deliverable in the course Physical Interaction 
            Design and included a fully developed concept alongside a small-scale 
            physical interactive model for an exhibition at KTH.
          </p>
          <h5 class="sec-heading">Team &amp; Personal Contribution</h5>
          <p>
            Ideation, prototyping, construction of the model, user experience and 
            interaction design were all done in collaboration with my teammates Melissa 
            Obrou, Okra-Livia Inkeri Dimle and Vincent Giardina.
          </p><p>
            Apart from the above, my contribution also involved the setup of the technology 
            (i.e. constructing the circuit, connecting the sensors and LED-strip) as well as 
            the programming of the script and the interaction with the sensors.

          <h5 class="sec-heading">About the Project</h5>
          <p>
            The theme for the project challenge was “Designing for a winter playground”. Our 
            team was tasked with designing a piece of interactive playground equipment fit 
            for outdoor play in the Swedish winter. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Playing outside no matter the season or the weather is a part of the Swedish 
            mentality (as the saying goes “there is no bad weather, only bad clothes”). 
            However, with the winter months lack of daylight past 3 p.m. and playgrounds 
            remaining poorly lit throughout the year, there is a lot that can be done to 
            improve the outdoor play environment. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose of this project was to explore how playgrounds could be fitted with 
            interactive technology, as well as the challenges of designing large scale systems 
            for cold, dark and wet play settings.

            Poor lighting at playgrounds make them seem both unfriendly and unsafe, far from the adventurous 
            environment they provide in daylight. Therefore we needed to figure out a way of bringing more 
            lights into the environment. Rather than just considering the lights an inanimate object we 
            wanted them to be integrated into the playfulness of the place.
          </p>
          <p>
            Playgrounds are highly active environments, meant for running around and having fun. Whatever 
            solution we would land in would have to encourage this sense of movement, but we also knew 
            that the winters often bring sudden downpour of rain or snow or a even the mix of both. Another 
            challenge was therefore to consider how our solution could function under those conditions 
            and in what ways we could include shelter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, playgrounds are multifunctional environments. They not only need to be able to cater to 
            both individual and social play settings, but to the needs of kids at varying ages. A 1-year-old 
            and a 7-year-old are not likely to approach a playground with the same eyes. Therefore, we wanted 
            our design to allow for an open-ended play setting, while still adding a sense of guided play and 
            mystery to also engage older children in the interaction.

          <h5 class="sec-heading">The Model</h5>
          <p class="mb-5">
            The small-scale model was built on a 900 SEK budget, where most of costs 
            went into the 200 addressable LED-lights that were used. Together with borrowed 
            and scrap materials, the trees were constructed using chicken wire, papier 
            mache and white paint. The electronics included an Arduino board, flex sensors 
            and a passive infrared motion sensor.
          </p>
          <h5 class="sec-heading">Tech</h5>
          <p>
            The interactive part of the installation was made through the creation of a 
            simple program for the Arduino board. The code was written using C/C++ and 
            listened to the installation’s 4 sensors (3 flex sensors, 1 infrared motion sensor). 
            Depending on which and how many of the sensors the user interacted with, the code 
            fired corresponding light scripts.
          </p>

        <div class="col-lg-1"></div>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h5 class="sec-heading">Inspiration</h5>
          <p>
            When it came to inspiration for our final design, we focused a lot on the small 
            joys of childhood, such as waking up to find a white winter landscape outside 
            your window. How the snow reflects and disperses light, making the whole world 
            sparkle.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for the shape of the trees in our model, we aimed at a more fairytale-like 
            style, taking inspiration from the mushroom forest of Alice in Wonderland. A 
            shape that was also favoured for its potential to also act as shelter from 
            harsh weather conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our way of making use of the lights was inspired by the movie Avatar and the 
            nighttime colours of the forest of Pandora, as well as modern day art installations 
            such as the Supertree Grove at the Gardens by the Bay in Singapore.

            Our final concept landed in the idea of an artificial winter forest that lights 
            up when interacted with. Every single tree is meant to be unique and different 
            types of interaction will trigger them. Some you might simply need to approach 
            (motion sensors) while others may react to touch, such as finding and pressing 
            a button or hugging the tree (pressure sensors).
          </p>
          <p>
            The interaction with the forest can be seen as a game, where you have to figure 
            out how to activate each tree, and perhaps discover through play that when more 
            than one tree is activated at the same time ‒ new exciting things happen. This 
            was also a way for us to attempt to meet both individual and social play needs 
            as well as engaging children at different stages of cognitive development. The 
            youngest children may just engage in pressing a button and be mesmerized by the 
            light show. Whereas older children can grasp and play the game; running around 
            and trying to get the whole forest to light up at once.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through connecting the trees and having them "communicate", we think that the 
            installation could spur both movement and social interaction. The idea for the 
            installation is that it is meant to be very tactile, as this is an important aspect 
            of how children interact with the world. This became particularly clear when we 
            tried out parts of our installation with preschoolers, who spent a long time 
            engaging with the pearl curtain we used for the installation's centrepiece, 
            simply because it was so nice to touch.

          <h5 class="sec-heading">Lessons learned</h5>
          <p>
            This was an incredibly fun project to work on for many reasons. Perhaps quite 
            obviously because we had to bring back our inner children and try to remember 
            what the thrill of the playground was. But also because it was a highly 
            explorative project. We got to bring out a lot of practical skills we had long 
            forgotten, such as soldering cables, connecting circuits and working with bench 
            power supplies. A key takeaway being that everything can be solved and that one 
            can master new skills at an impressive rate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Coming from a background where I’ve produced a lot of wireframes and prototypes 
            for apps and websites, it was really cool to get to work with physical models 
            and all the opportunities and constraints that came with it. It definitely 
            brought with it a newfound interest in physical product design and its 
            user experience.

          <h5 class="sec-heading">Outcomes</h5>
          <p>
            Our installation engaged people of all ages at the exhibition held at KTH. 
            Visitors particularly enjoyed the multicoloured “full forest dance” and spent 
            long periods of time interacting with the installation to trigger it. Because 
            of some minor technology bugs that led to delayed reactions, the visitors had 
            occasionally somewhat of a hard time figuring out how to trigger all sensors. 
            However, we found that this led to a more playful environment among the 
            visitors and to a higher degree made them cooperate with each other.
